    - Once configured, the strategy is confirmed and created, appearing on the home page and ready for action.

1. **Executing Strategies**:
    - Users deposit assets and allocate them among different nodes, such as collateral and sniper bots, before executing the strategy.
    - The platform manages all necessary transactions, approvals, and confirmations, providing a seamless trading experience.

1. **Monitoring and Management**:
    - The dashboard offers a detailed overview of active strategies, showing invested amounts, current balances, and returns.
    - Users can monitor their strategies, make adjustments, and reinvest profits through the dashboard.
